A tool that generates alpha bracelet patterns automatically from text &amp; emojis, with complete customization.

It lets you take any text in any font and colour and turn it into an alpha bracelet pattern.

You can add any font off of google fonts, drag and drop the text around so it is where you want it. I also added an approx length below the image so you can make sure it fits whoever's wrist it's meant for. You can switch up the pixel size to get higher or lower resolution text, adjust the canvas dimensions, font size, letter spacing, lots of stuff. Complete customizability, essentially!

If you turn on "Clip Colors" it removes the light purple/dark purple thing going on and makes it all one color (see image below)
